Overview
########

**CHESTER** is a versatile **NB-IoT** gateway for the Internet of Things. The NB-IoT technology (also referred as LTE Cat NB1) evolves as part of the 5G specifications. Optionally, the device can be equipped with the **LoRaWAN** connectivity (e.g. for local dense installations).

The gateway is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use thanks to its advanced **weatherproof enclosure** (IP67 rating). All the integrated components operate in a wide temperature range and the device can be used in harsh environmental conditions.

CHESTER is powered from a **high-capacity Lithium battery**. The advanced low-power optimization techniques enable the battery lifespan in the field of **up to 5 years**. The battery state (remaining capacity) is accurately reported via the network. Optionally, it can be powered from the external DC power supply (up to 28 V).

The device features **Bluetooth Low Energy** (BLE) connectivity for communication with the mobile app (both iOS and Android is supported). The communication uses an open **AT command interface**. It is also possible to upgrade the device firmware from the mobile app.

Optionally, the sensor can carry on-board satellite positioning module. Also, it is extensible with various communication interfaces - e.g. **RS-485** and **1-Wire** bus, simple analog sensors, pulse counters, etc.

CHESTER can be mounted to an object using screws or fastened to a pole using a cable tie. The product can be customized to customer's needs including logo UV-printing. It comes in two basic color variants - white (default option) and choral gray.
