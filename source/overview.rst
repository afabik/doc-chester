Overview
########

**CHESTER** is a versatile **NB-IoT** gateway for the Internet of Things. The NB-IoT technology (also referred as LTE Cat NB1) evolves as part of the 5G specifications. Optionally, the device can be equipped with the **LoRaWAN** connectivity (e.g. for local dense installations).

.. hint::

   NB-IoT and LoRaWAN fall in the category of LPWAN technologies (Low Power Wide Area Network). These networks offer long communication distance, low data bandwidth, and low integration cost in the devices.

The gateway is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use thanks to its advanced **weatherproof enclosure** (IP67 rating). All the integrated components operate in a wide temperature range and the device can be used in harsh environmental conditions.

CHESTER is powered from a **high-capacity Lithium battery**. The advanced low-power optimization techniques enable the battery lifespan in the field of **up to 5 years**. The battery state (remaining capacity) is accurately reported via the network. Optionally, it can be powered from the external DC power supply (up to 28 V).

The device features **Bluetooth Low Energy** (BLE) connectivity for communication with the mobile app (both iOS and Android is supported). The communication uses an open **AT command interface**. It is also possible to upgrade the device firmware from the mobile app.

Optionally, the sensor can carry on-board satellite positioning module. Also, it is extensible with various communication interfaces - e.g. **RS-485** and **1-Wire** bus, simple analog sensors, pulse counters, etc.

CHESTER can be mounted to an object using screws or fastened to a pole using a cable tie. The product can be customized to customer's needs including **logo UV-printing**. It comes in two basic color variants - white (default option) and choral gray.
