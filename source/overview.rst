Overview
########

**CHESTER** is a versatile **NB-IoT** gateway for the Internet of Things. The NB-IoT technology (also referred as LTE Cat NB1) evolves as part of the 5G specifications. Optionally, the device can be equipped with the **LoRaWAN** connectivity instead.

The gateway is suitable for indoor and outdoor use thanks to its advanced **IP67-rated enclosure**. All the integrated components operate in a wide temperature range and the device can be used in harsh environmental conditions.

CHESTER is powered from a **high-capacity Lithium battery** (primary cell, nominal voltage 3.6 V, chemistry LiSoCl2). The advanced low-power optimization techniques enable the battery lifespan in the field of **up to 5 years**. The battery state (remaining capacity) is accurately reported via the network. Optionally, it can be powered from the external DC power supply.

The device features **Bluetooth Low Energy** (BLE) connectivity for communication with the mobile app (both iOS and Android is supported). The communication uses an open **AT command interface**. It is also possible to upgrade the device firmware from the mobile app.

Also, it is extensible with various communication interfaces - **RS-485** and **1-Wire** peripherals, simple analog sensors, PLCs, etc.  CHESTER can be mounted to an object using screws or fastened to a pole using a cable tie. All of this can be fully customized to customer's needs.
